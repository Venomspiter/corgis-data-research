                    <td> A true picture of total weather-related delays requires several steps. First, the extreme weather delays must be combined with the NAS weather category. Second, a calculation must be made to determine the weather-related delays included in the "late-arriving aircraft" category. Airlines do not report the causes of the late-arriving aircraft but an allocation can be made using the proportion of weather related-delays and total flights in the other categories. Adding the weather-related delays to the extreme weather and NAS weather categories would result in weather's share of all flight delays. </td>
